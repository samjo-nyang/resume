  description: <a href="https://github.com/sparcs-kaist/sparcssso/" target="_blank">Github</a> &bull; SPARCS SSO is a single sign on service for SPARCS services, including <a href="https://otlplus.sparcs.org/">OTL+</a> and SPARCS internal wiki. It is based on Django 1.11, and it uses a custom protocol that originates from OAuth2, with some simplification applied (for example, there are no scope parameter and dialogs).
